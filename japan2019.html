title: Japan 2019
---

I was lucky enough to travel to Japan this past month, and this blog documents all the places I went to during my trip there from Nov. 28 to Dec. 14 in 2019. Hopefully, someone out there looking to travel to Japan (or is just interested in seeing what's out there) will find this helpful, or interesting.
