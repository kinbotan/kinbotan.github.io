### TeamLabs Borderless


On our first day after landing, we started our morning with a visit to [TeamLabs Borderless](https://borderless.teamlab.art/) in Odaiba, Tokyo. Odaiba is a bit out of the way in Tokyo, so it took us at least 40 minutes to an hour to get there by subway (we were staying two stops away from Ikebukuro). Once you get there, you'll see that Odaiba is a little amusement area with a ferris wheel, outdoor shopping, a Toyota showcase center, etc. So there is more to do in Odaiba, but we mainly went for TeamLabs Borderless. It's probably one of the most highly rated / overly instagrammed digital art exhibits out there, but if you've never been to anything like it, I definitely recommend going since its vast number of eye candy exhibits will not disappoint!

    We picked this place since it had decent reviews on TripAdvisor and it was near Asakusa Shrine (our next destination). The ramen was pretty heavy, but it was the most generous amount of noodles, soup, and fun delicious items in one ramen I've had compared to ones I've had in the USA. Fun fact: the ramen here has special ajitama (soft boiled) twin-egg yolks called Futago Tamago, and its supposedly very rare!

### Asakusa Shrine & Tokyo SkyTree Town
Next, we went to Asakusa shrine and Tokyo SkyTree town - both of which are yet another popular tourist spots. Asakusa shrine is one of Tokyo's most famous shrines in the city, and it has a great outdoor area for shopping and buying street snacks. Tokyo SkyTree town is a giant department store shopping center home to the Tokyo SkyTree tower (Tokyo's Space Needle), and Sumida Aquarium (cute penguins and jellyfish)! These two are neighboring each other, so its worth visiting both in the same day. It took us about another 40 minutes to an hour by subway to make it to the Asakusa area from Odaiba, but there's also a bus that directly goes to Tokyo SkyTree town for about the same amount of price and time.
