title: Tokyo - Day 1
---

On our first day after landing, we started our morning with a visit to [TeamLabs Borderless](https://borderless.teamlab.art/) in Odaiba, Tokyo. Odaiba is a bit out of the way in Tokyo, so it took us at least 40 minutes to an hour to get there (we were staying two stops away from Ikebukuro). Once you get there, you'll see that Odaiba is a little amusement area with a ferris wheel, outdoor shopping, a Toyota showcase center, etc. So there is more to do in Odaiba, but we mainly went for TeamLabs Borderless. It's probably one of the most highly rated / overly instagrammed digital art exhibits out there, but if you've never been to anything like it, I definitely recommend going since its vast number of eye candy exhibits will not disappoint!
